This is a global description of Swip to understand its architecture.
For more details : http://thesesups.ups-tlse.fr/2237/1/2013TOU30261.pdf

1 - Nl to Pivot
	Transforms a Natural Language (NL) Query into a pivot request
	The SwipWorkflow web service is used to call each web service 
	with the result of its predecessor
	1.1. NlToPivotGazetteer : Finds named entities + dates, etc. from the ontologies 
		you are working on via the Gazetteer 
		outputs the NL query with "_" instead of " " in named entities 
			ex : Who played in The Rolling Stones ?
				-> Who played in The_Rolling_Stones ?
	1.2. NlToPivotParser : Parses the gazetted sentence (grammatical analysis of the 
		NL query)
		outputs the dependency tree of the NL query
	1.3. NlToPivotRules : transforms the dependency tree into the pivot query
				ex : ?person: play= The_Rolling_Stones.
				
2 - Pivot to Sparql
	Transforms the pivot query into a Sparql query
	Only interrogates the sparql endpoint server
		- Creates a new instance of http://swip.univ-tlse2.fr/ontologies/Queries#query 
		in the queries named graph (of the sparql end point) and adds properties according
		to the pivot query on the new instance
		- Finds the best(s) pattern(s) and sub-pattern(s) in the patterns named graph 
		to match the query instance
		- Also finds the best matchings in the knowledge base named graph with elements 
		from the query (literals)
--> outputs the best matchings of sparql queries + a descriptive sentence for each one of them
	
	-once the query is output, it can be modified 
		(for example add graph <name of kb graph>{ ... query ...}) around the query to 
		interrogate the kb named graph of the sparql endpoint for client
	the sparql endpoint for client is interrogated with the sparql query by clicking on 
	the highlighted	field of the descriptive sentence
	
NB : the sparql endpoint server and sparql endpoint for client URL are different on 
	 the online swip version but they refer to the same sparql endpoint
